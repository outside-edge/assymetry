Winning the coin toss in cricket matters - we wouldn't have so many [debates](http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/964039.html) about it, much less the [changes in the English County Championship](http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2016/content/story/944565.html) this season, if it didn't. But the benefit of choosing heads or tails correctly varies widely across formats, conditions and how closely matched the teams are. When teams are closely matched, winning the toss has a sizable impact on the probability of winning.

Using ESPNcricinfo's own data, we looked at more than 44,000 cricket matches across all formats, from domestic first-class to international, and found that the team that wins the toss wins the match 2.8 percent more often. But that small advantage increased for One-Day International and List A matches, and decreased in Twenty20 contests, both domestic and international. It varied even more under certain conditions: for day-night ODI and List A matches, for example, the toss-winning side's chances of winning increased to nearly 6 percent. For Twenty20 matches, it's within the realm of possibility that winning the toss conveys no advantage, statistically speaking. (Our full write-up and the underlying data are [here](https://github.com/dwillis/cricket-stats).)

Winning the toss does appear to convey an advantage in First Class and Test matches, where pitches can deteriorate, giving the team that bats last a tougher challenge. But the largest boost appears to be in one-day matches.

None of this proves that winning the toss guarantees a team an increased chance of winning, of course. But the data are clear: in many cases, there is a small but significant potential advantage for teams that choose correctly. Whether teams are able to capitalize on this advantage matters, too, and weaker teams may see little benefit.

Playing conditions, which occupy a large portion of pre-match commentary, matter as well. It's not surprising that we found that in ODI, List A and T20 matches where the Duckworth-Lewis rule was invoked, teams that won the toss won the match even more often than when full matches were played. These findings probably won't reassure critics of Duckworth-Lewis, since in theory winning the toss in either situation should convey approximately the same benefit. It would be worth a fuller exploration of whether Duckworth-Lewis has some bias in it that makes winning the toss more important.

Other factors influence the outcome of a cricket match, not the least of which is the quality of the sides involved. Using ICC monthly rankings for international sides, we looked at whether winning the toss made a difference when teams were closely matched or at opposite ends of the rankings. When closely matched teams play, winning the toss has a larger impact on the probability of winning. As expected, the impact of winning the toss was less when a clearly better side played a weaker one.

We also looked at international side performance: are some countries better than others at capitalizing when they win the toss? The data aren't clear on this: there are small but insignificant boosts for most sides, with the exception of New Zealand. The Black Caps seem to do better in matches where they lose the toss, while Sri Lanka and India seem to enjoy the greatest benefit.

To try to counter some of the advantages that home sides could enjoy in English domestic matches and to encourage spin bowling, English County Championship matches this season will not have a mandatory toss. The visiting team can choose to field first, and if not, then the toss occurs. The data on the impact of winning the toss in England are similar to the overall picture - a small but significant advantage is gained by the side that wins the toss - with one glaring exception: matches played in April.

Whether due to cold weather or to grassy pitches that can make batting difficult, teams that won the toss in April matches in England lost nearly 5 percent more often than they won. In every other month, the toss-winner was more likely to win the match. Perhaps that alone will encourage visiting captains to take the field first, at least at the start of the season.
